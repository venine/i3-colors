**Available Scripts:
*Some script to make my experience less annoying.* 
1. executeScript : Take filename as input and execute it with the correct program. The output shall be displayed.
2. i3color.py : Change the bezel colors of i3 windows.
3. setKeyboardLayout : Switch to swapcaps based on whether I am using the laptop keyboard or the computer keyboard. If I am using a computer keyboard, use swapcaps as the additional option.
4. setWallpaperRandom : Set a Wallpaper (jpg/png) from a list in a random manner. However, you need to have ~/Wallpapers in your ~ folder.
5. swapWorkspace : Got the script from somewhere. It helps you in changing workspaces. Just pass in the INTEGER of the desired workspace. It shall be swapped with your current one. 


I shall keep adding new scripts soon.
